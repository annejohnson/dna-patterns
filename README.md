# DNA Patterns

This uses homologous DNA sequences across a few parrot species to generate patterns. In a given pattern, the size of a circle indicates which nucleotide (A, G, C, or T) exists at that position for a particular species. The color set resembles a species' actual colors.

Each DNA sequence is from the species' NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (mitochondrial) and is available through the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

## TODO
- Get more species
- Put geography data and species name
- Try sequential animation rather than all-at-once
- Add a play button that fireworks through the different species
