# DNA Patterns

This uses homologous DNA sequences across a few parrot species to generate patterns. The colors in each pattern are similar to the birds' actual colors. Each DNA sequence is from the species' NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (mitochondrial) and is available through the [National Center for Biotechnology Information](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

## TODO
- Get more DNA sequences
- Put geography data and species name
- More efficient rendering
  - Only render the number needed to fill screen
- Responsive rendering
  - Smaller circles on smaller screen sizes
- Try sequential animation rather than all-at-once
- Add a play button that fireworks through the different species
- HTML best practices
  - Add meta tags, GA, etc.
